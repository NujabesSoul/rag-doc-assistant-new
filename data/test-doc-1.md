# Document Management Best Practices

Document management involves organizing, storing, and tracking documents throughout their lifecycle. This mirrors the Scholar's Web principle - structured knowledge that compounds over time.

## Core Benefits
- Improved organization and searchability (finding your past thoughts quickly)
- Better collaboration (sharing knowledge with future you)
- Reduced cognitive load (external memory instead of mental juggling)
- Audit trail and compliance (when did I learn this? where did it come from?)

## Implementation Tips
Always establish naming conventions before creating documents. Use folder hierarchies that match your mental models - Source Material, Thinking Canvases, Main Notes, Creations, Canon. Implement automated backup systems (3-2-1 rule).

The key insight: document management isn't about filing. It's about reducing friction between having a thought and being able to reference it later. That's what makes knowledge compound.
