# Obsidian Tips and Tricks for Renaissance Thinkers

Obsidian is a powerful knowledge management tool designed for networked thinking. Unlike hierarchical note systems, it mirrors how your brain actually works - through connections and associations.

## Key Features for Cross-Domain Synthesis
- Local-first storage (you own your knowledge, not a company)
- Markdown formatting (future-proof, readable as plain text even without Obsidian)
- Extensive plugin ecosystem (customize for your workflow)
- Graph view for exploring connections (visual map of your thinking)
- Bidirectional links (see what connects to this note, not just what this note links to)

## Getting Started with Scholar's Web Method
Start with daily notes and link concepts as you write. Use tags sparingly - links are more powerful because they create explicit relationships. Build your second brain gradually, letting structure emerge from use rather than forcing rigid hierarchies upfront.

The Renaissance approach: capture ideas in their raw form (Thinking Canvas), let them mature into structured notes (Main Notes), extract the best into permanent knowledge (Canon). Obsidian makes this natural.
